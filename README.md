# ff06b5
Hexadecimal clock inspired by the Cyberpunk 2077 FF06B5 mystery.

Time is displayed as a 24-bit hexadecimal value. The 24-hr. day is divided into 2^24 time segments. Thus, midnight is 00:00:00. 8:00 AM is 55:55:55. Noon is 80:00:00. 3:00 PM is AA:AA:AA. FF:06:B5 is 11:54:31.35, a likely time of day in Cyberpunk Red and Cyberpunk 2077 lore at which a nuclear bomb detonated inside Arasaka Tower. Etc.

As time move forwards, the hex clock and equivalent normal clock update in real time. 

The background color is the HTML web color represented by #xxxxxx, where x's are the hex digits of the current hex time. 

To edit the time to a specific value, simply click and edit the hex or normal time fields. Once a valid entry is entered, the background color and other clock will update, but the clock remains paused so you may study this particular value.

To reset back to the running clock based on your local time, simply press reset.

This code was written by AI based on my prompts and hypothesis about the FF:06:B5 mystery in Cyberpunk 2077.
